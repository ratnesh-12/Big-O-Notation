# Algorithm Analysis using Big-O Notation

## 1. What is Algorithm Analysis?

Algorithm analysis is the study of how efficiently an algorithm performs in terms of **time** and **space**.  
It helps evaluate how an algorithm behaves as the size of input data grows.

- **Time Complexity:** Measures how the execution time changes with input size `n`.  
- **Space Complexity:** Measures the additional memory an algorithm needs based on input size.

Analyzing algorithms allows us to **compare efficiency**, predict scalability, and optimize code without running multiple test cases.

## 2. Why Do We Use Big-O Notation?

**Big-O notation** expresses the **upper limit** of an algorithm’s running time or memory usage.  
It focuses on how performance grows asymptotically — i.e., when input size becomes very large.

- It simplifies performance measurement by ignoring **constants** and **lower-order terms**.  
- It gives a **mathematical estimate** of efficiency, independent of hardware or implementation language.

## 3. Common Big-O Complexities

| Complexity | Name | Example | Description |
|-------------|------|----------|--------------|
| **O(1)** | Constant Time | Accessing a hash map value | Execution time doesn’t depend on input size |
| **O(log n)** | Logarithmic | Binary search in sorted data | Very efficient for large datasets |
| **O(n)** | Linear | Iterating through an array | Time increases proportionally with input |
| **O(n log n)** | Linearithmic | Heap Sort, Merge Sort | Common for optimized sorting algorithms |
| **O(n²)** | Quadratic | Insertion Sort, Matrix multiplication | Slows down quickly with larger data |
| **O(n³)** | Cubic | Triple nested loops | Rarely acceptable for large inputs |
| **O(2ⁿ)** | Exponential | Recursive subset generation | Impractical for big datasets |
| **O(n!)** | Factorial | Permutation generation | Extremely inefficient for even moderate `n` |

## 4. Steps to Perform Algorithm Analysis

1. **Identify key operations** — Focus on operations that dominate the algorithm (like loops or recursion).  
2. **Count the occurrences** — Determine how many times these operations execute relative to input size.  
3. **Express as a function of `n`** — Represent the running time or space as `f(n)`.  
4. **Simplify using Big-O rules** — Keep the most significant term and ignore constants.

### Examples

**Example 1: Linear Traversal**
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (arr[i] == target) return i;
}
```
→ **O(n)**

**Example 2: Nested Loops**
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        // Constant-time operation
    }
}
```
→ **O(n²)**

**Example 3: Binary Search**
```cpp
int start = 0, end = n - 1;
while (start <= end) {
    int mid = (start + end) / 2;
    if (arr[mid] == key) return mid;
    else if (arr[mid] < key) start = mid + 1;
    else end = mid - 1;
}
```
→ **O(log n)**

## 5. Simplification Rules for Big-O

- **Ignore constants:** `O(3n)` → `O(n)`  
- **Keep dominant terms:** `O(n² + n)` → `O(n²)`  
- **Multiply for nested loops:** `O(n × m)` for two dependent loops  
- **Add for sequential operations:** `O(n) + O(m)` → `O(n + m)`

---

## 6. Space Complexity

- **Definition:** Measures the **extra memory** an algorithm uses besides the input.  
- **Example:** A recursive algorithm that stores intermediate calls has extra **stack space**.  
- **Case:** Merge Sort requires **O(n)** extra space for temporary arrays.

## 7. Why Big-O Notation Matters

Big-O helps developers and researchers to:

- **Estimate performance** for growing inputs  
- **Compare algorithms** without coding or testing  
- **Choose scalable solutions** early in the design process  
- **Optimize software** for better time and memory usage

It acts as a **common language** for discussing efficiency, regardless of programming language or platform.

## 8. Conclusion

Big-O notation is a **cornerstone concept** in algorithm design and computer science.  
It enables developers to:

- Predict how runtime or memory requirements scale with input size  
- Make informed decisions when selecting algorithms  
- Focus on significant factors affecting performance

Understanding Big-O ensures efficient, scalable, and optimized program design — an essential skill for **software engineers, competitive programmers, and computer science students**.
